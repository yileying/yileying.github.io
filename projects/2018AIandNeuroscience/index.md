# Spiking Neural Networks for Spatial Navigation (a.k.a. an Artificial Rat)  

## [2018-Feb] Summer Research Scholarship (Undergraduate 2nd Year)  
  
&nbsp;  
The conference paper and the slides below both provide a summary of the project:  

- Y Ying, A Ross, A Siddique, WN Browne, [*Minimum Requirements for an Artificial Rat*](https://www.irit.fr/devonn/files/ppsn_short_2018_CrC.pdf), The Fifteenth International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (2018)  
- [Slides: The Navigation Mechanism in a Rat Brain.pdf](/Slides-The_Navigation_Mechanism_in_a_Rat_Brain.pdf)  
  
&nbsp;  
During this project, I produced a series of notes on the the major parts in a rat brain involved in spatial representation,  in terms of their connections, functions, and lateralisation.  
Here is a summary (originally the "Read-me" file for the series of notes):

Here are the notes for individual parts in a rat brain:
