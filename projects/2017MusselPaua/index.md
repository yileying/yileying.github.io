# Muscle Power a.k.a. Mussel Paua  

## [2017-July] Individual Course & Hobby Project (Undergraduate 2nd Year)  
  
&nbsp;  
Do you want to control computer programs (e.g.  playing video  games)  by  flexing  muscles instead of using a mouse/keyboard/joystick?  
Here I have two variants of an interface to allow you to do that.  
The first one is in LabVIEW, working with National Instruments data acquisition board. The other one in Processing (Java), working with Arduino. Both interface get the input from the Myoware Muscle Sensor.  

&nbsp;  
The slides below give an overview of this project and an introduction to the LabView version:  

- [Slides: Overview and Intro to the LabVIEW Version.pdf](/Slides-overview_and_intro_to_the_LabVIEW_version.pdf)  

&nbsp;  
The code:

- The code for the LabVIEW version can be downloaded [here](MusclePower_LabVIEW.zip)  
- The code for the Processing (Java) version can be found in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/yileying/Mussel-Paua)  

&nbsp;   
Ps: [Mussel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perna_canaliculus) and [Paua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ua) are two types of popular shellfish in New Zealand, and they appear in the built-in game in the Processing version ;)
