# Augmented Reality (AR) for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  

## [2018 Dec] Summer Research (Undergraduate 3rd Year)  

*Supervisor:* [*Sergei Obruchkov*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergei-obruchkov-47703713a/?originalSubdomain=nz)  

&nbsp;  
I developed an AR JavaScript app to aid doctors in aligning the position of patients with the magnetic field during MRI.  The 3D objects in the app are modeled in 3D slicer and Blender.  
Here is my app and documentation:
